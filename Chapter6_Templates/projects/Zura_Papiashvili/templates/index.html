    <h2 align="center">Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects</h2>

<p> The generation of electricity by wind energy has the potential to reduce environmental impacts caused by the use of fossil fuels. Although the use of wind energy to generate electricity is increasing rapidly in the United States, government guidance to help communities and developers evaluate and plan proposed wind-energy projects is lacking. Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects offers an analysis of the environmental benefits and drawbacks of wind energy, along with an evaluation guide to aid decision-making about projects. It includes a case study of the mid-Atlantic highlands, a mountainous area that spans parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. This book will inform policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels.US Ecology's network of facilities and service centers provide recycling services for everything from organic to universal waste. We customize our recycling programs to fit your specific needs while meeting regulatory requirements and helping protect the environment.
